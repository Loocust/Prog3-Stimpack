Wow factor:

The JavaServer Faces + Facelets framework was used to implement the View portions of the application.

The JSF framework allowed us to use a template engine to separate the "container" elements of the website design from the content.

It also allowed us to easily bind forms to objects using controls such as <h:form>..<h:inputText>, reducing the amount of code required to handle form submission.

Other elements such as <c:forEach> allowed for easy iteration over collections, and <c:commandButton> / <c:commandLink> allowed for easier organisation of actions such as add(), edit(), delete().
